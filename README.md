**M** stands for **Mega** — but don’t get me wrong, it’s not meant to sound overhyped.  
It’s just my way of reminding myself that this isn’t “just another simple calculator.”  

This repo is where I try to push myself with projects that are:  
- not too meta or abstract,  
- still practical enough to be deployed,  
- and useful for improving my “hibernating” (problem-solving + coding) skills.
